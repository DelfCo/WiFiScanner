# WiFiScanner
Shows you local WiFi access points

## To do list:
1. Add some code
2. Try to do this not using MVVM, by using converters:

    a. Use converters to show channel numbers
    
    b. Use a more advanced converter to show signal strength as a bar graphic
    
3. Redo the whole thing so it uses MVVM.
